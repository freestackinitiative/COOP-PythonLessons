However, it is a fundamental concept that you need to get more comfortable with if you're going to use the language.\n","\n","Slicing lets us select only the items that we need from a container. It is similar to the `SELECT` statement in SQL. Recall that we can use `SELECT * FROM table` to get all the columns in a table. But if we want to only select some columns, we need to specify them (e.g. `SELECT name, age FROM person`).\n","\n","Here is the structure of the syntax:\n","`object_i_want_to_slice[start : stop : step]`\n","\n","Let's break that down a little more:\n","- `object_i_want_to_slice`: This is our container object. Slices are performed on containers, so we always start with this first\n","- `start`: This is the index number that I want to begin my slice with\n","- `stop`: This is the index number that I want to stop before. This value is exclusive, so the item at the index you specify here will NOT be included in your slice.\n","- `step`: This allows you to specify if you only want every `x` amount of items from your slice. The default value for this `1`, which means that you want to include every item. If you were to specify another number, say `2`, that would give you every second item in your slice. If you use `3`, then it would give you every third item in your slice, and so on. \n","\n","Here are some examples:\n","```python\n","my_list = [\"Apple\", \"Pear\", \"Banana\"]\n","# Select just the \"Apple\"\n","my_list[0] # Returns \"Apple\"\n","# Select \"Pear\" and \"Banana\"\n","my_list[1:3] # Returns [\"Pear\", \"Banana\"]\n","# Select \"Apple\" and \"Banana\" but skip \"Pear\"\n","my_list[0:3:2] # Returns [\"Apple\", \"Banana\"]\n","```\n","\n","Handy slicing tricks to remember:\n","- You can reverse the items in a container with this line (replace `my_container` with your container): `my_container[::-1]`\n","- `my_container[0]` always gives you the first item in your container\n","- `my_container[-1]` always gives you the last item in your container\n","\n","*Note: Slicing only applies to `string`, `list`, and `tuple` containers.
